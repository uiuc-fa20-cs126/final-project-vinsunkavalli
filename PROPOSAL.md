# Raycaster Adventure Game

My final project idea is to create a game that runs a simulated 3d environment using raycaster graphics to create a dungeon to explore

## Personal Interest

As a kid, I wanted to code raycasters for a long time in Scratch (progamming language for kids) because it only had 2D graphics. Games like the original Doom and Wolfenstein used this, and it looked incredible to me at the time.

## Timeline

Roughly, this is the timeline I would follow:
* Week 1: I would complete everything necessary for raycasting (ie creating a world map, a moveable player entity, inventory, etc.)
* Week 2: I would use these functions to implement the raycasting graphics functionality (this is where cinder is important)
* Week 3: I'd add polish the game and add features like items and entities to make it play more like a game

## Stretch Goals

Some cool features I'd like to add as bonuses:
* Adding music as well as sound effects
* Adding visual effects like warping the screen and fade transitions
* Adding functionality to render multiple heights of blocks (really hard)
