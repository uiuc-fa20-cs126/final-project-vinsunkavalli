#Procrastination Prevention App

My final project idea is to create an app to prevent procrastination by making the user go cold turkey. For example, it will block the user from opening games or using the internet and admonish the user for anything they do wrong.

##Personal Interest

I honestly think that this idea is one that I would be interested to work in. Not only do I struggle with procrastination, but I've made an extension to prevent me from going onto distracting sites before so I'd consider myself reasonably qualified

##Timeline

Roughly, this is the timeline I would follow:
 * Week 1: I would complete the basic functionality (ie reading apps running, time, internet access)
 * Week 2: I would use these functions to implement the basic app(closing apps and turning off the internet)
 * Week 3: I'd add extra features like challenges to disable the app and verbal/visual feedback to improve the experience beyond barebones

 ##Stretch Goals

 Some cool features I'd like to add as bonuses:
 * A stats tracker that keeps track of hours focused, distracted etc.
 * A system that gives you free time and breaks etc.
 * Overlay that lets the app draw info on top of whatever work you're doing
